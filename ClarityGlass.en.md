## Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-29

### 1. Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how “Magnifying Glass” (the “App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles your information. The App functions as an on-device magnifier using the device camera to display a live preview for magnification.

### 2. What We Collect

- Personal Data: We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data from the App.
- Images/Video: The live camera preview remains on your device and is not saved or uploaded by the App.
- Diagnostics: We do not use analytics by default.

### 3. Device Permissions

- Camera: Required to display a live preview for magnification.
- Flashlight: Optional, to improve visibility in low-light environments.

### 4. Advertising

The App may display banner ads. Advertising partners (e.g., Google AdMob) may independently collect device information to provide, measure, and personalize ads under their own policies.

- AdMob Policy: [Google AdMob & Google Marketing Platform Policies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
- Google Privacy: [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

We do not control how third-party SDKs process data. Please review their policies to understand their practices.

### 5. Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age where parental consent is required by applicable law. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 6. Data Retention

We do not retain personal data. Camera previews are not stored by the App.

### 7. Security

Although we do not collect personal data, we follow platform best practices and minimize data access (camera/flash only as needed).

### 8. International Transfers

Third-party advertising providers may process data on servers located in other countries. Refer to their policies for details.

### 9. Your Choices

- You can disable camera access in system settings. Doing so will limit the App’s functionality.
- Manage advertising preferences via your device settings and third-party opt-out mechanisms.

### 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
